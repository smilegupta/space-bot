### What is Serverless
Serverless computing allows you to build and run applications and services without thinking about servers. With serverless computing, your application still runs on servers, but all the server management is done by AWS. Using AWS and its Serverless Platform, you can build and deploy applications on cost-effective services that provide built-in application availability and flexible scaling capabilities. This lets you focus on your application code instead of worrying about provisioning, configuring, and managing servers.

### Why build a serverless application?
Building a serverless application allows you to focus on your application code instead of managing and operating infrastructure. You do not have to think about provisioning or configuring servers since AWS handles all of this for you. This reduces your infrastructure management burden and helps you get faster time-to-market.

##### Building a serverless application offers you four main benefits:
- No server management
- Flexible scaling
- High availability
- No idle capacity

### How do I build a serverless application?
You can build a serverless web application by using several AWS services together. Each service is fully managed and does not require you to provision or manage servers. You only need to configure them together and upload your application code to AWS Lambda, a serverless compute service.

### Installing Serverless
###### ```npm install -g serverless```
